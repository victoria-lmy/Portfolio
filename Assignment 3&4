# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design
The original data visualization is https://www.statista.com/statistics/1092688/awards-shows-racial-gender-diversity-us/
My first draft is as follows:

Include a short paragraph on why you selected this particular data visualization.

Documentation for redesign:
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Document answers to your questions and reflect on them. Did you learn anything interesting from the feedback on your initial design?

A couple paragraphs describing what your process was.  You should include a few insights you gained from the critique method, 
and what it led you to think about when considering a redesign, if anything.  You should talk about how you moved next to the wireframes, 
and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  If it led you to change anything about your data visualization's design, 
mention what that was.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, 
why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently.
