# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design
The original data visualization is this following link: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1092688/awards-shows-racial-gender-diversity-us/
I Selected this particular data visualization is because I am interested in the entertainment industry and how this industry projects impacts to the society at large. Another reason is that the data contained in this data visualization is relatively complete to explain the story which the author wants to convery, which enables me to focus on the data presentation instead of searching and cleaning data in the redesign process. The original graph is complete and able to understand but there is still room to make the graph more robust.

My first draft is as follows:

Documentation for redesign:
I consulted my friends how they perceive my first draft and what they know from looking at it in the first sight. All of them said they can see the percentage change inside each of the segments in the four bars, but they thought its a picture of four different things. And three of them said that although they saw the "percentage" label, they still would perceive the amount on the bar as count instead of percentage. After gathering their thoughts and feeedbacks, I reflect on how to show this data visualization in two pairs instead of four unrelated, individual aspects. And the amounts shown on the bars without the percentage sign is confusing, since it violates people's common sense. When people see numbers, they will automatically think them as count and sum, instead of percentage.

Redesign process:
1. I changed the title by deleting some redundant description. The original title is "Share of adults who were more concerned about the diversity of awards shows nominees and winners after seeing the facts in the United States as of January 2020", which is too long and unnecessary. I changed this statement into a more direct insight: "People were more concerned about the diversity of awards shows after seeing the facts in the United States".
2. I then removed the x-axis label as its redundant.
3. The original graph is a bar chart, but I thought a stacked bar chart would be better to show the shifts of people's attitude before and after. To accomplish this, I first created four stacked bars, and then change the intervals between them so that the four bars can appear to be in two groups. Then I put "Before" and "After" as x-axis label. Since the first two bars are all about gender diversity and the last two are all about racial diversity, I removed the duplicate desciption in the x-axis, and put "gender diversity" and "racial diversity" above the bars, further indicating which bars belong to which group.
4. Although I have already put "percentage" on the y-axis, indicating that all the numbers are in percentage, I changed the numbers shown on the bars into percentage just for the sake of clarification.
5. As for the colors, I used crossed lines to represent "before" and color-block to represent "after". This choice is made due to the concern that people normally pay more attention to more solid colors then shady area. Therefore, in this way, audience attention will be automatically drawn to the two "after" bars.

Here is my redesign graph:
