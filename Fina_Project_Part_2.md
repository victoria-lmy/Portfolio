# Creation of a user research protocol and completion of at least three interviews
1. the target audience: any audience who are confused about which streaming platform he/she should subscribe to in the U.S.
2. identify representative individuals to interview: I interviewed students at Heinz College with various backgrounds, with one from information system major, one from entertainment industry management major and one from public policy major. One of the reasons why I chose Heinz students is because they are the active user group for streaming platforms and this topic may relate to them more.
3. interview script:
- Can you describe to me what the storyline is telling you?
- Who do you think is the intended audience? If this is not clear, are there ways to make it clearer?
- Are those picture or icon there appropriate?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
-	Is there anything you would change or do differently?
-	Is there any additional information you would like to know?
-	Did you get any new idea or understanding of the topic from this?
-	How would you rank, in terms of the importance to the audience, all of these dimensions?
4. the findings from the interviews:
- Perception of the wireframe:
All of them can tell that this is a guidline introducing to the confused potential subscriber when choosing which streaming platforms, by using various matrix to measure different dimensions. But two of them thought I did not give out any result or suggestion, the whole project is more like a pure analysis without any definite suggestion. This feeling comes mostly from the last wireframe graph that all of them felt a bit confusing. After I explained what I would like to address in the last part, all of them suggest that I should put the ranking in the very beginning of that page and put the detailed description in the bottom so that the readers will know immediately what my suggestions are.
- Aspects that will be helpful to add:
The interviewer from the entertainment industry major suggested that he would like to know how many shows under each genre does each streaming platform provide. The interviewer from the information security major suggested that he would like to know the association and similarities between platforms, such as platform A and B are similar in providing horror films, so that he can know which platform he would probably feel interested to switch into once he gets tired of his current subscription. The interviewer from the public policy major suggested that she would like to know the interface of different platforms as she would prone to the one that has more friendly user page.
-	Ranking:
Three of them all ranked "the development history" as the least aspect that they would care about, and "the quantity of the shows available on the platform" as the most aspect that they would pay attention to, since they would prefer to stick to one platform and be able to watch all the shows he/she wants. Two of them ranked the "qualitative analysis" as the second, saying that they pay more attention to the image quality. One of them ranked "price of the subscription" as the second. Two of them ranked "price of the subscription" as third. This indicating that the young generation cares more on the convenience and the quality of the streaming platforms (since they do not like to change streaming platforms from time to time), and though they are still price sensitive, they put this sensitivity behind the quality. Another thing worth noticing is that two of my interviewers put "annual spending on content" as the second last thing they would care about, saying that they do not really care or believe that more investment on the content will guarantee a higher quality on the programs the platforms offer. This can be an insight to the streaming companies when investing on original content, as audience may looking for more niche contents and platforms can find approaches to spend investment that can pin point the audience interest without spending tons of money to create cliche episodes.

5. changes I implemented to my wireframes to address the issues identified:


# Revised wireframes based on what you heard
Finally, you'll put these changes into practice in your wireframes / storyboards.  Begin refining your wireframes / storyboards reflecting what you've identified and learned through your user research.   For the purpose of this assignment, your final wireframes should essentially be an early draft of your final project that includes your project outline, sketches, and brings your storyboards to life.  For most of you this will mean that you've created a digital outline or shell that you can then begin to further refine and improve heading into Part III, and it should begin to feel complete enough that an external reviewer can easily tell how you're beginning to craft your story.  Therefore you should begin taking your outline and building out the structure of your story into 

 note similarities and differences between the observations of your interviewees.
