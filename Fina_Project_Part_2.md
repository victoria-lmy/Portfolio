# Creation of a user research protocol and completion of at least three interviews
You should have also developed a simple user research protocol that describes what you hope to find during your user interviews, including your research questions and the script.  Once your interviews are complete, you should have documented findings that detail what you've learned by showing your early wireframes / storyboards to at least three different individuals.  
Your user research protocol should clearly identify the following: 
a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story; 
b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; 
c. your interview script; 
d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you implemented to your sketches, storyboards and wireframes to address the issues identified.

# Revised wireframes based on what you heard
Finally, you'll put these changes into practice in your wireframes / storyboards.  Begin refining your wireframes / storyboards reflecting what you've identified and learned through your user research.   For the purpose of this assignment, your final wireframes should essentially be an early draft of your final project that includes your project outline, sketches, and brings your storyboards to life.  For most of you this will mean that you've created a digital outline or shell that you can then begin to further refine and improve heading into Part III, and it should begin to feel complete enough that an external reviewer can easily tell how you're beginning to craft your story.  Therefore you should begin taking your outline and building out the structure of your story into whatever you identified in your Part I proposal.   
Optional: moodboards and personas
You may find it helpful to use a moodboard to both identify examples of what has worked well when visualizing similar datasets, as well as any general themes in color, typography, or other elements.  Use your moodboards to help construct your story further.   Personas can also be used to help you create a representation of the kind of readers you expect to address with your final project.  Both these artifacts will help you in Part III should you choose to create them. 


Include your written user research protocol and findings.  Make sure not to including any personally identifiable information (don't list names or identifiable information about those you interviewed - describe them generally).   Include any helpful direct quotes for each question you asked, and make sure to note similarities and differences between the observations of your interviewees.
