# Final data story
## Audience
The intended audience for my final data story are general audience who have trouble choosing which streaming platforms they should subscribe.
I create a model to evaluate the five selected streaming platforms and provide a ranking with scores breakdown to give out reference and suggestions for my intended audience. The detail of how the model works is as follow: first, I assign scores, from 1 to 5 with 5 suggesting the best, for each platform under each category. For example, for total contents available, Amazon Prime Video gets a 5 since it has the most content library. But for the subscription price category, the lower the better, so Disney+ gets a 5.Then, I attached different weights to different categories. I give 0.4 to quantity of contents available, 0.3 for subscription price, 0.15 for annual spending on contents, 0.1 for current number of subscribers, and 0.05 for the launch timeline. These numbers are based on the interviews and surveys I conducted at Heinz College.Finally, I sum product the scores and weights in terms of categories, and reach a total score of: 4.4 for Amazon Prime Video, 3.7 for Netflix, 2.85 for Hulu, 2.3 for Disney+, and 1.75 for HBO Now.
## Work I've done
1. I chose the topic of streaming wars and narrow it down by only analyzing the top 5 streaming platforms in the five aspect/categories which are Quantity of shows available, Price of the subscription, Annual spending on content, Current subscribers, Development history. 
2. I created a model to evaluate the five selected streaming platforms and provide a ranking with scores breakdown to give out reference and suggestions for my intended audience. 
3. I searched related information and data online and cleaned them to form insights.
4. I interviewed Heinz College students on the five aspects, and built wireframe of my final presentation using Balsamiq.
5. I modified the aspects in measuring the streaming platforms, including deleting the aspect of qualitative analysis, because many interviewees felt that this aspect is somewhat overlapping other aspects. And I also changed the order of the aspects. Initially, the order is Development history, Subscription prices, Annual spending on content, Number of contents available, Qualitative analysis, Current number of Audience. Then I reorganized the order according to the feedback from my interviewees. The main change is to put the Development history from the first place to the last one. 
6. I made the final presentation using the Shorthand platform.
7. I consulted the TA of this class about the rankings.
## Reflection
I felt that coming up with ideas is easy, but structure these ideas into a logic, aethetic and infomative work is tough. The hardest part I encountered when doing the job is cleaning and filtering the data I found and formed them in a structured format. The other thing is that I felt the wireframing process is very helpful to clear out the thoughts.
