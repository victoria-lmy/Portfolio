# Outline
Summary:
As a student majoring in entertainment industry, I am really interested about the current streaming wars. As there are more and more streaming platforms rising up, audience become confused about which platform they should subscribe. The purpose of this final project is to help audience to analyze which streaming platform is the most promising one that worth the investment (subscription). 

Project Structure:  
The project will analyze the top 5 streaming platforms: Netflix, Amazon, Disney+, HBO and Hulu from four dimensions, and will provide a weighted average score for audience to reference.

The four dimensions are as follows:
1. the history of running the platform (the launch data). 20% 
2. the annual spending on content. 30%
3. the quantity of shows available on the platform. 30%
4. the number of current subscribers. 20%

The percentage listed at the end of each dimension is the weighted number. The ranking number will be displayed in an order where 5 is the best, and 1 is the poor. The final score will be calculated by multiplying the weighted percentage with the respective ranking.
Please refer the following picture for the 'call to action' and 'story arc'.

# Initial Sketches
You may choose to present your sketches and integrate them into Part I of your final project in whatever fashion
Your sketches should mimic aspects of your outline, and build on the resounding message you want to make clear 
Your sketches themselves do not have to be visually correct / accurate

# The Data
you'll need to get a copy of the data you'll need for your final project, 
or recreate it based on various sources.  
Make sure in all cases to record your sources and cite these data sources appropriately. 
1. A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
2. A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, 
or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, 
Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  
If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first. 

# Method and Medium
In a few paragraphs, you should document how you plan on completing your final project.  
One option we've already discussed is building a story using your data using Shorthand - 
but this is my no means your only option.  You may select another digital platform (e.g. Esri's Story Maps, etc.), 
or you may propose doing something else entirely (AR / VR, mixed media, etc.).  
If you choose to do something significantly outside of the technologies we've introduced in this course, please talk to me first. 
I'd like all final projects to be documented digitally, so if you create something using physical materials  or more immersive, 
you may need to also create a video recording of your story. 

Finally, for your final project I'd discourage an over-reliance on PowerPoint slides. 
If you need to use a few slides to frame the context of your final project presentation (a pitch deck) that's ok - 
but your Powerpoint slides alone are not sufficient in meeting the requirements of the final project deliverable.  
Your final project deliverable must be an interactive, stand-alone project 
(e.g. something you've created using Shorthand or another platform) 
that won't require a future employer clicking through yet another PowerPoint deck.
