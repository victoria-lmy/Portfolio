#Outline
1. Summary:
As a student majoring in entertainment industry, I am really interested about the current streaming wars. As there are more and more streaming platforms rising up, audience become confused about which platform they should subscribe. The purpose of this final project is to help audience to analyze which streaming platform is the most promising one that worth the investment (subscription). 

2. Project Structure:  
structure, major elements
call to action
outline user stories

Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe the story arc that you hope to achieve.  

# Initial Sketches
We've explored how sketching can be a great way to help solidify your ideas into design choices, 
and for your proposal you'll be creating sketches that outline your initial thoughts for your final project.  
You may choose to present your sketches and integrate them into Part I of your final project in whatever fashion you feel
makes the most sense - but they should be clear enough to be understandable to someone that has little to no contextual background
for your project.  Your sketches should mimic aspects of your outline, and build on the resounding message you want to make clear 
through your project.  Build in elements of your anticipated story structure for your project.  Your sketches themselves do not have 
to be visually correct / accurate and you may use whatever method makes the most sense to you (hand-drawn, digital, etc.). 

#The Data
you'll need to get a copy of the data you'll need for your final project, 
or recreate it based on various sources.  
Make sure in all cases to record your sources and cite these data sources appropriately. 
1. A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
2. A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, 
or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, 
Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  
If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first. 

#Method and Medium
In a few paragraphs, you should document how you plan on completing your final project.  
One option we've already discussed is building a story using your data using Shorthand - 
but this is my no means your only option.  You may select another digital platform (e.g. Esri's Story Maps, etc.), 
or you may propose doing something else entirely (AR / VR, mixed media, etc.).  
If you choose to do something significantly outside of the technologies we've introduced in this course, please talk to me first. 
I'd like all final projects to be documented digitally, so if you create something using physical materials  or more immersive, 
you may need to also create a video recording of your story. 

Finally, for your final project I'd discourage an over-reliance on PowerPoint slides. 
If you need to use a few slides to frame the context of your final project presentation (a pitch deck) that's ok - 
but your Powerpoint slides alone are not sufficient in meeting the requirements of the final project deliverable.  
Your final project deliverable must be an interactive, stand-alone project 
(e.g. something you've created using Shorthand or another platform) 
that won't require a future employer clicking through yet another PowerPoint deck.
