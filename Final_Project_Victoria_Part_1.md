# PART ONE
## The Outline
Summary:
As a student majoring in entertainment industry, I am really interested about the current streaming wars. As there are more and more streaming platforms rising up, audience become confused about which platform they should subscribe. The purpose of this final project is to help audience to analyze which streaming platform is the most promising one that worth the investment (subscription). 

Project Structure:  
The project will analyze the top 5 streaming platforms: Netflix, Amazon, Disney+, HBO and Hulu from four dimensions, and will provide a weighted average score for audience to reference.

The four dimensions are as follows:
1. the history of running the platform (the launch data). 20% 
2. the annual spending on content. 30%
3. the quantity of shows available on the platform. 30%
4. the number of current subscribers. 20%

The percentage listed at the end of each dimension is the weighted number. The ranking number will be displayed in an order where 5 is the best, and 1 is the poor. The final score will be calculated by multiplying the weighted percentage with the respective ranking.
Please refer the following picture for the 'call to action' and 'story arc'.

## The Data
The data source:
1. https://observer.com/2019/10/netflix-disney-apple-amazon-hbo-max-peacock-content-budgets/
2. https://www.axios.com/disney-netflix-content-spending-b7cc36a9-0d4a-495b-a191-01020e099a6e.html
3. https://www.fastcompany.com/90410798/netflix-spent-an-estimated-15-billion-on-original-content-in-2019-ahead-of-disney-and-apple-tvs-launches

I found a overall introduction to the current landscape of the streaming wars among the major platforms on Fast Company website. It has data relates to the biggest original content deals, the current US subsribers, the quantity vs quality of the shows provided etc. But these figures are not in a uniform style. Sometimes Fast Company will only focus on one platform (and it's normally Netflix) and sometimes it focuses on the comparison of 3 to 4 platforms. Thus, I would like to gather more information to complete the comparison based on the data Fast Company already has.

From Observer, I found the the spending on content creation for each of the big streaming platforms and their breakdown of the budget. This can serve as the complementary data source to the Fast Company one.
A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Axios did a pretty much similar job as Observer. The reason why choose this data source is to have a well-rounded and relatively non-biased opinion and data support when generating insights based on that. Thus, back-up/supporting data source can be very helpful.

## Method and Medium
I am planning to use Shorthand to complete my final project with the help of Balsamiq wireframe, Datawrapper, Tableau and Rawgraphs.

First I will introduce how many streamig platforms are there to indicate the difficult situation for audience when choosing which streaming platforms they should subscribe. Maybe use an explicit example to mimic the situation when audience struggling choosing the platforms.

Second, I will narrow down my research topic by picking out the top five streaming platforms (Netflix, Amazon, Disney+, HBO and Hulu) to do the further analysis based upon the four dimensions I mentioned above.

Third, I will gather the data to complete the comparison among these five platforms and give out rankings. This is the part where I will generate one graph for each of the dimensions. Then I will do the weighted score to finalize which platform is the most well-rounded, promising one that worth audience to subscribe. The finalize ranking will also be a data visualization.

## Creation of a user research protocol and completion of at least three interviews
1. the target audience: any audience who are confused about which streaming platform he/she should subscribe to in the U.S.
2. identify representative individuals to interview: I interviewed students at Heinz College with various backgrounds, with one from information system major, one from entertainment industry management major and one from public policy major. One of the reasons why I chose Heinz students is because they are the active user group for streaming platforms and this topic may relate to them more.
3. interview script:
- Can you describe to me what the storyline is telling you?
- Who do you think is the intended audience? If this is not clear, are there ways to make it clearer?
- Are those picture or icon there appropriate?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
-	Is there anything you would change or do differently?
-	Is there any additional information you would like to know?
-	Did you get any new idea or understanding of the topic from this?
-	How would you rank, in terms of the importance to the audience, all of these dimensions?
4. the findings from the interviews:
- Perception of the wireframe:
All of them can tell that this is a guidline introducing to the confused potential subscriber when choosing which streaming platforms, by using various matrix to measure different dimensions. But two of them thought I did not give out any result or suggestion, the whole project is more like a pure analysis without any definite suggestion. This feeling comes mostly from the last wireframe graph that all of them felt a bit confusing. After I explained what I would like to address in the last part, all of them suggest that I should put the ranking in the very beginning of that page and put the detailed description in the bottom so that the readers will know immediately what my suggestions are.
- Aspects that will be helpful to add:
The interviewer from the entertainment industry major suggested that he would like to know how many shows under each genre does each streaming platform provide. The interviewer from the information security major suggested that he would like to know the association and similarities between platforms, such as platform A and B are similar in providing horror films, so that he can know which platform he would probably feel interested to switch into once he gets tired of his current subscription. The interviewer from the public policy major suggested that she would like to know the interface of different platforms as she would prone to the one that has more friendly user page.
-	Ranking:
Three of them all ranked "the development history" as the least aspect that they would care about, and "the quantity of the shows available on the platform" as the most aspect that they would pay attention to, since they would prefer to stick to one platform and be able to watch all the shows he/she wants. Two of them ranked the "qualitative analysis" as the second, saying that they pay more attention to the image quality. One of them ranked "price of the subscription" as the second. Two of them ranked "price of the subscription" as third. This indicating that the young generation cares more on the convenience and the quality of the streaming platforms (since they do not like to change streaming platforms from time to time), and though they are still price sensitive, they put this sensitivity behind the quality. Another thing worth noticing is that two of my interviewers put "annual spending on content" as the second last thing they would care about, saying that they do not really care or believe that more investment on the content will guarantee a higher quality on the programs the platforms offer. This can be an insight to the streaming companies when investing on original content, as audience may looking for more niche contents and platforms can find approaches to spend investment that can pin point the audience interest without spending tons of money to create cliche episodes.

5. Changes I implemented to my wireframes to address the issues identified:
I add a pie chart to show how many streaming platforms are there in the industry, in order to demonstrate the fierce competition and the confusion it can easily shed upon potential subscriber. For development history, I changed the indicator into the logo of the company as I think this will be more direct for the reader. I changed the sequence of the dimensions. Previously, the sequence is development history, subscription price, annual spending on content, quantity of shows available, qualitative analysis and current subscribers. Now, I changed them according to the ranking from the interviews, which is quantity of shows available, price of the subscription, qualitative analysis, annual spending on content, current subscribers and development history. Besides that I also changed the ranking page, by putting the ranking on the very top and the detailed breakdown at the end. As for the addition elements brought up by the interviewers, I value all of them. However, when it comes down to reality, it is very hard to realize. For example, the comparison between interfaces is a good point, but aesthetic beauty is a very subjective measure and is hard to give a definite score on that.
