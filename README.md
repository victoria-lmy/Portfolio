# About me
Hello! I am Victoria, a student in the Telling Stories with Data course. I am in the MEIM (Master of Entertainment Industry Management) program and would like to pursue a career in consulting after graduation. As we all know, entertainment industry is an industry requires creativity. Thus, the data presentation in this industry also requires high level of creativity. From my past experience working in the consulting industry, I obtained some level of data visualization methods and can convey the message effectively. But there is still a long way to go in presenting the data in an aesthetic way.

# What I hope to learn
My overall expectation of this class is hoping to learn how to present data in an effective and aesthetic manner. Alongside, I would love to learn how to use Tableau and many other data visualization tools.
